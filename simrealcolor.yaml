# Define some other information about the images 
image :
    
    # If we specify the sky_level as an image attribute, it will be used
    # as a background level for the image.  (The background level per pixel is 
    # 1.e6 * (0.15)^2 = 2250.)
    sky_level : 1.e6  # ADU / arcsec^2

    # Since we already specified a sky_level for the whole image, we don't need
    # to repeat it for the noise.  So in fact, everything is default here.
    # So we can just set the noise to an empty dictionary, which means use all defaults.
    # (If we omit it entirely, that would mean no noise, which isn't what we want.)
    #
    # Also, if we include a sky_level in noise in addition to the above image sky_level,
    # then both of them (added together) will be used for the noise, but only the 
    # image.sky_level will remain as the background level in the final image.

    # We can also offset the object from the center of the image.  We had previously
    # (in demo4 and demo5) used galaxy.shift as a way to shift the center of the image.
    # Since that is applied to the galaxy, the units are arcsec (since the galaxy profile
    # itself doesn't know about the pixel scale).  Here, the offset applies to the drawn
    # image, which does know about the pixel scale, so the units of offset are pixels, 
    # not arcsec.  Here, we apply an offset of up to half a pixel in each direction.

    # Note: since the output includes a data_cube output, which requires all the
    # images to be the same size, GalSim will choose the size of the first image

    # but then subsequent images will be forced to be the same size as the first one.
